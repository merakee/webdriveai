<p>drive.ai reserves the right at any time and for any reason to modify, or temporarily or permanently discontinue, the App, or any portion thereof, with or without notice. You agree that drive.ai shall not be liable to you and to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the App.</p>
<li><strong>Suspension and Termination Rights</strong></li></ol>
<p>The Terms, as may be amended from time to time, will remain in full force and effect as long as you continue to access or use our App. You may terminate the Terms at any time by discontinuing use of our App. Your permission to use our App automatically terminates if you violate these Terms. </p>
<p>We may terminate or suspend any of the rights granted by these Terms and your access to our App with or without prior notice, at any time, and for any reason. The following provisions survive the expiration or termination of these Terms for any reason whatsoever: Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability; Indemnification; Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, Class Action Waiver; and Miscellaneous.</p>
<li><strong>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</strong></li></ol>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND DRIVE.AI TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM DRIVE.AI.</p>
<p><u>Arbitration Agreement</u>. You and drive.ai agree that all claims and disputes relating in any way to your use of our App, or arising out of or in connection with these Terms, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, on an individual basis, except for disputes which can be resolved in small claims court, any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents, or any dispute already pending at the time you first agree to these Terms. You also agree that any arbitration will take place in [_______].</p>
<p><u>Waiver of Jury Trial</u>. IN THE EVENT ARBITRATION IS CONTRARY TO APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND DRIVE.AI WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and drive.ai are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration is the referral of a claim or dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the claim or dispute and making a final binding determination to resolve it instead of having it decided by a judge or jury in court. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p><u>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions, or Representative Actions</u>. YOU AND DRIVE.AI AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT CLAIMS AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS OR OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION, OR ON BEHALF OF ANY INDIVIDUAL OR OTHER GROUP. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND DRIVE.AI AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S) OR DISPUTE. ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER DRIVE.AI USERS.</p>
<p><u>Arbitration Rules</u>. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Any arbitration between you and drive.ai will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available at www.adr.org.</p>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></li></ol>
<p>The Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect. Headings are for reference only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to any failure by you or others to comply with these Terms does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar failures. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent, and any assignment or transfer in violation of this provision shall be null and void. There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.</p>
<li><strong>Copyright Infringement Claims</strong></li></ol>
<p>drive.ai reserves the right to remove any content or any other material or information available on or through our App, at any time, for any reason. drive.ai otherwise complies with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) applicable to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C. § 512, as amended), and responds to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. This Section ‎‎XXI describes the procedure that should be followed to file a notification of alleged copyright infringement with drive.ai. </p>
<p><u>Notification of Claimed Copyright Infringement</u>. If you have objections to copyrighted content or material made available on or through our App, you may submit a notification to our Designated Agent at the following address: </p>
<p>[<strong>insert drive.ai DMCA Agent contact information</strong>].</p>
<p>Any notification to drive.ai under 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) alleging copyright infringement must include the following information:</p>
<li>An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right being infringed; </li>
<li>An identification of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; </li>
<li>An identification of the content or material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on our App;</li>
<li>Information sufficient for drive.ai to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, and/or email address;</li>
<li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the content or material of which you are complaining is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
<li>A signed statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.</li>
