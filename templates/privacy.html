<p><strong>drive.ai Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>Last Modified: <strong>June 22 2018</strong></p>

<ol><li><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></li></ol>
<p>This policy describes the types of information drive.ai (“drive.ai”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) may collect from you or that you may provide when you use the drive.ai mobile application (the “App”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. This privacy policy does not apply to any application or website operated by third parties. </p>
<p>This policy does not apply to information collected by us offline or through any other means, or by any third party, including through any application or content that may link to or be accessible from or on the App. Also, you may be subject to different privacy policies or terms of service for other applications or websites. </p>
<p>drive.ai is committed to protecting your privacy. Please read this policy carefully. If any term in this policy is unacceptable to you, please do not use the App or provide any personal information. By accessing or using this App, you signify your acknowledgment of this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Revisions to Our Privacy Policy below) and your use of the App after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this policy periodically for updates. </p>
<li><strong>Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It</strong></li></ol>
<p>We collect several types of information from and about users of our App, including information:</p>
<ul><li>By which you may be personally identified, such as name, e-mail address, telephone number, geographic location, social media information, background information, or any other information collected on the App that is defined as personally identifiable information under applicable law (“personal information”); and/or</li></ul>
<li>About your Internet connection, the equipment you use to access our App, and usage details.</li></ul>
<p>We collect this information:</p>
<li>Directly from you when you provide it to us. </li>
<li>Automatically as you navigate through the App. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.</li></ul>
<p><i><strong><u>Information You Give to Us</i></strong></u>. The information we collect on or through our App may include:</p>
<li>Information that you provide on our App. </li>
<ul><li>This includes information provided when you sign up for an account; when you make a request; when we process or respond to your inquiries related to requests; and when you provide feedback on our App. </li></ul>
<li>Payment processing information. </li>
<li>To make payments to us, you will need to provide billing information, such as a name, address, email address, and payment card information. When you provide or update your payment information, we transmit the payment via an encrypted connection to a third-party credit card processor.</li>
<li>Records of your ride history.</li>
<li>Your customer services requests, including correspondence and dispute resolution. </li>
<li>If you contact our technical support for assistance with our services, or when you send us messages or suggestions or communicate with us in any other way, we will collect the information you provide. We retain copies of all correspondence with customers. We will collect your name and email address so that we may reply to your requests through our support desk.</li>
<li>Your responses to questions that we might ask you to complete.</li>
<li>Your search queries on the App.</li>
<li>Your actions inside the drive.ai vehicle.</li></ul>
<p><i><strong><u>Information We Collect About You</i></strong></u>. As with many other mobile applications, as you navigate through and interact with our App, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your actions within a drive.ai vehicle, equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:</p>
<li>Camera videos and photos. </li>
<li>Use of our services requires that you consent to use of an in-vehicle camera that will record what is happening inside of the vehicle at all times. The purpose of this in-vehicle camera is for safety and to handle various situations that may arise inside of the vehicle. </li>
<li>Location information. </li>
<li>We collect information about your estimated location which may be deduced by various technologies, including IP address. You consent for us to collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</li>
<li>Details of your use of our App, including traffic data, location data, logs, language, date and time of access, frequency, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the App.</li>
<li>Information about your mobile device and Internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, and browser type.</li>
<li>Details of referring websites (URL). We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking).</li></ul>
<p>The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may include personal information. We may also maintain it or associate it with personal information you provide to us or that we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. It helps us to improve our App and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:</p>
<li>Estimate our audience size and usage patterns.</li>
<li>Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our App according to your individual interests.</li>
<li>Speed up your searches.</li>
<li>Recognize you when you return to our App.</li></ul>
<p>As with many other applications and websites, our App may use “cookies” or other technologies to help us deliver content specific to your interests, to process your reservations or requests, and/or to analyze your use patterns. We may collect the following types of information about your use including: the domain from which you access the Internet; IP address; operating system and information about the device used when accessing the App; date and time of your use; content you viewed or downloaded; and website (such as google.com or bing.com) and website referral source (email notice or social media site) that connected you to the App. Our App uses two types of cookies: single-session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Temporary cookies last only as long as the App is open, and are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation through our App. Once you close the App, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your device for longer periods and are used for purposes including tracking the number of unique users of our App and information such as the number of views a page gets, how much time a user spends on a page, and other pertinent statistics. Cookies, by themselves, will not be used by drive.ai to disclose your individual identity. This information identifies your operating system, but not you, to our servers when you use the App. We do not respond to “do not track” signals. We may also collect data by using “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “pixel tags”) that allow us to know when you use our App. Through pixel tags, we obtain non-personal information or aggregate information that can be used to enhance your online experience and understand traffic patterns.</p>
<p><i><strong><u>Information We Receive From Other Sources</i></strong></u>. This is information we receive about you if you use any of the websites we operate or other services we provide. We sometimes work with third parties and they sometimes provide information about you. We obtain information from such third parties with whom we work to provide you with services (including, for example, sub-contractors, analytics providers, and search information providers). </p>
<p>In addition, we may use third-party providers to serve or track interactions on other websites. You may link to or access our App using other third-party websites. Use of such third-party websites is subject to the terms of service and privacy policies of those third parties. Drive.ai does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<li><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></li></ol>
<p>We may use information collected about you, including personal information, in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>To complete any registration or other transactions you request online such as requesting a ride, payment processing, or any other action you request online. </li></ul>

<li>To operate the App and perform any services associated with the App, which may include creating an account for you and communicating with you.</li>
<li>To provide you with information that you have requested or to respond to your inquiries.</li>
<li>To determine eligibility for registration, use, employment, and other benefits. </li>
<li>To provide you with technical support and to improve our App and services.</li>
<li>To ensure that content from our App is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your mobile phone, to allow you to participate in interactive features of our App (when you choose to do so), and as part of our efforts to keep our App safe and secure.</li>
<li>To measure or understand the effectiveness of communications we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant communications to you and to provide you with communications from drive.ai, surveys, newsletters, and other information. </li>

<li>To design and develop new features, products, and services.</li>
<li>To notify you about changes to our services or the App.</li>
<li>To enforce this privacy policy, the terms of service, and any other terms that you have agreed to, including to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or any other person, or the copyright-protected content of the services. </li>
<li>For any purpose where you have given your consent (where legally required). </li>
<li>To comply with applicable federal and state law.</li>
<li><strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong></li></ol>
<p>We may disclose aggregated, anonymized information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. </p>
<p>You agree that we have the right to disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:</p>
<li>To anyone you have authorized disclosure of information in this privacy policy or any other consent or policy. </li>
<li>To service providers that assist us in the maintenance, improvement, and optimization of our App.</li>
<li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you sign up for certain services, we may share your information in order to provide those services. </li>
<li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information or with your consent.</li>
<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with applicable law.</li>
<li><strong>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</strong></li></ol>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with control over your information: </p>
<li><strong>Tracking Technologies and Advertising.</strong> You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our App may then be inaccessible or may not function properly. </li>
<li><strong>Do Not Track.</strong> We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals as we do not track our customers across third-party websites. </li>
<li><strong>Data Security</strong></li></ol>
<p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. </p>
<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain<strong> </strong>parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the App.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our App; any transmission is at your own risk. </p>
<li><strong>Third-Party Websites</strong></li></ol>
<p>Our App may contain links or references to other websites outside of our control. Please be aware that this privacy policy does not apply to these websites. drive.ai encourages you to read the privacy statements and terms and conditions of linked or referenced websites you enter. These third-party websites may send their own cookies and other tracking devices to you, log your IP address, and otherwise collect data or solicit personal information. <strong>DRIVE.AI DOES NOT CONTROL AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THIRD PARTIES DO IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR WEBSITES, OR HOW THEY HANDLE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. PLEASE EXERCISE CAUTION AND CONSULT THE PRIVACY POLICIES POSTED ON EACH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION</strong>.
</p>

<p>In general, our App is not intended for children under 18 years of age, and drive.ai does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children under the age of 18. No one under the age of 18 may provide any information to or on the App. By using the App, you confirm that you are not under the age of 18.
